# CPE Final Project
Swamp Cooler
Cole Gilliam & Jordan Cadelina
-DHT sensor was not able to work

VIDEO DISCLAMER
-DHT sensor not implemented so going to RUNNING state was done by pushing the START / STOP button as an adaption


COMMITS
-Code was worked on in person so no commits were consistantly made

Technical Documents
-The technical documents we used were goodnotes
-Kept track of everything we needed to know or understand
-Tinkercad was considered but they did not have a water level sensor so we never used it
